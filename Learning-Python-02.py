#Variables
#This part is about Variables

#So you may ask "What is Variable?" => Actually Variables are anything you give them a name
#e.g. :
#Name = "Daniel"
#Last_name = "Tajik"

#So if you want to run a Variable you you should print the name od Variable
#e.g. 

Name = "Daniel"
Last_name = "Tajik"
Age = 17

print(Name)
print(Last_name)
print(Age)

#if you run the above command , you will see :
#Daniel
#Tajik
#17

#Tip1: Do not put numbers between "" 
#Tip2: Print Variables without "" , Just write the name of Variables in ()
# Tip3: Just pay attention what you write to avoid making mistakes
# Tip4: Whenever you have an error , just look what your error is (mostly in output section it tells you your 
# error , e.g. Traceback (most recent call last):
# NameError: name '....' is not defined)
