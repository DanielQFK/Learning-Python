# what is input?
# what is int?

# e.g. 

name = input()

# "inpute" is used to ask for a variable...
# output = what is your name ? >  Daniel (in this part you should enter your name)

# Even you can explain what you want or not to make obvious that for someone who wants to 
# follow what you want...
name1 = input("What is your name? ") #Tip:anything between () is shown in output

age = int(input())
age1 = int(input("How old are you? "))

# "int(input())" is used to ask for an integer...
# output = How old are you ? > 17   (in this part you should enter your age)
# Tip 1:Be careful int is only for number . if you enter variable it will have an error in output
