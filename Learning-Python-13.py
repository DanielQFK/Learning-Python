# while loop

# While loops are so similar to for loops but in some differences
# 1.
# in while loop you should explain a condition which means it will stop 
# when the condition is not true . Until the condition is true it keeps on working ...
# e.g.
while "hello"=="hello":
    a = input("your name ? ")
# of course hello is the same hello so it's true (it keeps on to uncountable number)    
# or
while True==False:
    a = input("Hi > ")
# Now because it is not true nothing shows up in the output...
#or
x = 0
while x!=5:
    print("Hi")
    x = x+1
# But in this it will stop when x = 5    

# 2.
# But in For loop you don't have to explain a condition , Just say a number to continue 
# till it finishes... 

# IMPORTANT TIP : Don't try while by printing something because it keeps on and it may 
# damage your computer...
